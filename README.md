## Hi! I'm √Ålvaro

I am a **software engineer** from Santiago de Compostela, Spain. I currently mainly do **DevOps** and **VueJS** frontend, but I have experience and training in other areas and technologies, such as Android.

I am passionate about **automation** and **clean code**. As a consequence, I am very interested in strongly automated development processes (CI/CD), containerization and other ways to improve code quality and developer experience.
